# Human Pose Estimation using Hour-Glass model

This is just a re implementation of human pose estimation using hour-glass model and the person object detection was detected based on yolov3 weight file which i used here through transfer learning.




### Note:
+ This Repository is still in developing mode.
+ Requirements.txt, hardware requirements and my exact results everything will be updates soon. As I have implemented in my University lab.

### Usage:
Training:
+ 3D_Pose/detect is used to train the pose estimation model
```python
        python ./detect.py
```
